WE= Workshop Exercise

-WE1-
Loading setup makes the solution not work, while adding those lines in 
the actual solution file works fine. Why?

\ n nameless function of parameter n used for ease

quickcheck test needs to have n>=0 to work, else the test fails. 
The assumption itself gives different numbers if n<0 so this is correct.
added n>=0 in quickcheck and test works.

`div` works but not the (/) function
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7368926/division-in-haskell
apparently in haskell / is used in Fractions while div with Integers

-WE2-
Same as WE1, but different function. Use map(^x) to make the set
use every number to the power of x

-WE4- 
Unsure if this is correct. Test runs forever which I assume is
due to the large number of elements that can be in the lists.
This is a hard property to test but is it because of the size?
Or is it because of the nature of the property?
It not working with integers and instead having to use bool
tells me that we are testing against the definition(?) of the
property instead of something more robust like a standard int result.
