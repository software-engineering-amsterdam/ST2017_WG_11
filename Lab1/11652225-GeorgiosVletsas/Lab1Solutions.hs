{-| use luhn to write functions isAmericanExpress, isMaster, isVisa :: Integer -> Bool for checking whether an input number is a valid American Express Card, Master Card, or Visa Card number. Consult Wikipedia for the relevant properties.{
1. From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, and moving left, double the value of every second digit. If the result of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 Ã— 2 = 16), 
then add the digits of the product (e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or alternatively subtract 9 from the product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).
2. Take the sum of all the digits.
3. If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
